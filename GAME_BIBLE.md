# Formation Break — Game Bible

## Identity
- **Game name:** formation-break
- **Tagline:** "The moment before the shatter."
- **What is the player?** A targeting nexus — an ancient pulse-circle suspended in the void, waiting for the perfect instant to unleash destruction.
- **What does the world feel like?** A black void with faint geometric grid lines pulsing beneath. Enemies descend as crystalline geometric formations — sharp, cold, beautiful. The only sound is the hum of your targeting ring and the crystalline chime of shattered forms.
- **Emotional experience:** Exhilaration + precision. The thrill of the perfect timing.
- **Reference games:** Beat Hazard (rhythm tension), Threes/2048 (geometric simplicity), Super Hexagon (timing precision)

## Visual DNA
- **Color palette:**
  - Deep void black (#0a0a0f)
  - Electric cyan (#00ffff) — targeting ring, shockwave
  - Hot magenta (#ff0066) — enemies, formations
  - Soft gold (#ffcc00) — score text, multiplier
- **Visual reference:** Geometric crystalline formations against void, glowing wireframe aesthetic with bloom
- **Post-processing:** Bloom (high intensity), vignette (subtle)
- **Player silhouette:** Glowing cyan ring with inner pulse — 5 words: "breathing cyan circle of death"

## Sound DNA
- **Music identity:** Dark ambient synthwave — pulsing bass, sparse crystalline arpeggios. Slow build tension.
- **Music ↔ gameplay:** Music intensifies as formation approaches center. Shockwave triggers bass drop. Chain hits add staccato notes.
- **Key sound effects:** 
  - Targeting hum (constant low drone)
  - Formation approach (rising pitch)
  - Shockwave release (deep boom)
  - Enemy shatter (crystalline chime)
  - Chain multiplier (ascending ping)
  - Miss/fail (low discordant thud)

## Mechanics
- **Core loop:** Wait → Watch formation descend → Tap at perfect moment → Shockwave destroys enemies → Score multiplier → Repeat
- **The one thing the player learns to master:** Timing — the exact millisecond when formation density peaks over the ring
- **Controls:** Single tap (anywhere on screen)
- **Win/lose condition:** Score accumulates. Miss 3 formations = game over. Win = complete all 5 levels.

## Progression
- **Level 1:** "First Contact" — Simple solid squares, slow descent, straight down
- **Level 2:** "Hollow Forms" — First hollow rings, straight down, medium speed
- **Level 3:** "Diagonal Approach" — Angled formations, mix of solid/hollow
- **Level 4:** "Decoy Clusters" — Fake dense centers, mixed angles, faster
- **Level 5:** "The Swarm" — Complex multi-cluster formations, varied angles, fast
- **What changes each level:** Speed, formation complexity, hollow vs solid ratio, approach angles
- **The moment:** The shockwave expanding outward through a dense formation — enemies exploding into particles in a perfect circle

## World & Lore
- **World premise:** You are the Last Nexus — an ancient targeting system from a dead civilization. Enemy formations are remnants of an automated defense grid. Each shatter releases captured energy. Your mission: clear the grid to restore the network.
- **Environmental storytelling:** 
  - Floating debris particles in background
  - Faint grid lines beneath that pulse when you score
  - Formation colors shift slightly each level (magenta → purple → red)
